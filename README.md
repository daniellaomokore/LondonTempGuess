* Run the 'models.py' file to create your database table.

* set up your environmental variables in an .env file in the root. With variables for USER = "[your MYSQL user]", DATABASEPASSWORD = "[your MYSQL password]" ,HOST = "[your MYSQL host]" and SECRET_KEY = "[your secret key]"

‚ùî <b>Follow-Up Questions</b>: ‚ùì

‚óè Framework/libraries did you use for the front-end and back-end: 

 ‚óè Flask - I used the Flask framework to create the app since it's a small web application which would allow me to render html templates and use flashes to notify users of their attempts number + if their guess was correct or incorrect , also use of sessions to store data.

 ‚óè csv - to open the csv file
 ‚óè random - to get random rows from the csv file
 ‚óè datetime - to format the datetime to make it more readable on the frontend
 ‚óè flask_sqlalchemy - to communicate with the database with SQLAlchemy instead of using raw sql to prevent sql injection
 ‚óè flask_wtf/FlaskForm -to create submission form with csrf token and validators 


‚óè If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
> New feature: Add a steaks feature if user got a few correct in a row & feature for users to choose their answer out of three temperatures to make it easier.
> I would also save the csv into a variable to make it less expensive so that it doesn't have to access the csv file each time a new date and time is selected.

‚óè What steps did you take to future proof the application for possible expansions?
> Using a base html so that I can easily make it a multi-page web app if I wanted to expand it without repeating code
Using Unit Testing to make sure the code functionality is working as expected 


‚óè Which part of the challenge are you most proud of and why?
> I'm most proud of the efficient and scalable backend system developed for the web app and the seamless integration of the backend with the frontend, which provides a smooth and responsive user experience & the unit testing and mocking.

‚óè Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
> The functionality to ensure that the csv was validating the correct tempearture against the users temeprature guess whilst also refreshing the page without calling the same function twice on the GET and POST request. Also session cache issues with certain browsers.
